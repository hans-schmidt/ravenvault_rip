              <li>2020-07-25: Footnote #3 has been improved to insure
                that the total RVN supply is accurately maintained even
                when there are round-off errors during "face value"
                calculations</li>
              <li>2020-07-22: Additional implementation details and a
                use case have been added</li>

            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>What:</b> The purpose of this RIP is to modify the
                Ravencoin consensus core protocol to enable fungible
                assets on the Ravencoin blockchain to have native value
                in the form of Ravencoin currency (ie a "face value"). </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Why:</b> The Ravencoin protocol is an extension
                of the bitcoin protocol design which natively supports
                the creation and management of assets. But adoption and
                use of those assets depends on the traditional legal and
                banking systems to establish the link of value between a
                Ravencoin asset and a real world asset. The result is
                that the rate of adoption of Ravencoin is determined by
                the rate of adoption of blockchain technology by the
                traditional legal and banking systems. Currently,
                Ravencoin lacks the ability to assign value to on-chain
                assets denominated in the local Ravencoin currency. This
                is an oversight because the flexibility built into the
                Ravenocoin protocol can fully support this with the
                ability to securely and atomically trade between the
                asset and the currency in a single transaction. </li>
            </ul>

            <u><b>Q &amp; A</b></u><br>
            <br>
            <b>Q:</b> Why is this desired?<br>
            <b>A:</b> This capability would give Ravencoin powerful
            functionality to more fully participate in the
            cryptocurrency and fintech ecosystems. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q:</b> Can you give an example?<br>
            <b>A:</b> Business founders could distribute assets as
            ownership shares, or people could buy those assets as always
            envisioned for Ravencoin assets. But now, the profits from
            the business can be used to do "monetizeasset" transactions,
            thereby giving the distributed assets immediate value. That
            value could be hodled or traded. Or it could be cashed out
            at any time by doing a "meltasset" and selling the resultant
            Ravencoin currency on any of the exchanges. This model is
            especially powerful for businesses which earn their income
            in cryptocurrency, but it could be used for any business.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Q:</b> Would the sale and transfer price of an asset
            always be determined by the quantity of Ravencoin currency
            held in escrow for that asset?<br>
            <b>A:</b> No. Assets would have a "face value" determined by
            the escrow amount. But assets would have a higher trading
            price determined by the market based on people's
            expectations for the future value of that asset as well by
            the perceived value of the company or community which the
            asset represents. Additionally, there may be real world
            assets attached by traditional legal means to the on-chain
            asset which are not visible on-chain but which can increase
            its trading price.<br>
            <br>
            <u><b>Additional implementation explanation:</b></u><br>
            <blockquote>At present, the nodes keep track of the UTXO set
              for both RVN and assets. For assets, that implies keeping
              track not only of the creation and transfer history
              bitcoin-style, but also of some metadata (units,
              reissuability, etc). The nodes already have to track that
              metadata and changes to it just like UTX0 changes. This
              concept adds an additional Raven_Fund metadata number to
              every asset name, which represents the number of RVN
              backing that asset name. All nodes know what the current
              Raven_Fund number is for each asset name, just as they
              know the other metadata and the UTXOs from the transaction
              history. The sum of all the Raven_Fund (RF) numbers plus
              the sum of all the RVN at addresses is the total RVN
              supply, which is fixed by the whitepaper and changes only
              due to miner rewards. That can be thought of as an
              extended UTXO dataset, and the RFs for all the assets can
              be thought of as pseudo-addresses. <br>
              <br>
              Anyone can transfer RVN from an address into an asset
              name's Raven_Fund using a new RPC which specifies the
              asset name and the qty of RVN, which increases the value
              of all the assets issued with that name. This is a
              "monetize" transaction. The nodes track these transfers as
              their extended UTXO dataset and know where the RVN are.
              The "face value" of any single asset token is equal to the
              number of RVN in the Raven_Fund divided by the number of
              tokens in circulation, and all nodes know that number.<br>
              <br>
              Assets can be transferred as usual. If the recipient of
              some assets wants to "cash them in", then he can execute a
              "melt" on those assets. To support this, there is a 2nd
              new metadata number attached to every asset name which I
              call Authorized_Quantity (AQ), and it is also tracked by
              all nodes as part of the extended UTXO dataset. The sum of
              all the assets at addresses plus the AQ for that asset
              name equals the total number of assets issued by that
              name. The AQ is the number of existing assets temporarily
              removed from circulation just as the Raven_Fund is the
              number of RVN temporarily removed from circulation. A
              "melt" operation increments the AQ number for the asset
              and removes the assets from the owner's address. It also
              decrements the Raven_Fund number for the asset, and puts
              RVN into the owner's address. AQ and RF can be thought of
              as pseudo-addresses and all nodes track their change as
              part of the extended UTXO dataset.<br>
              <br>
              As usual, you can name assets whatever you want. In fact
              you can "monetize" RVN into an asset which you "issue"d
              months ago. Raven_Fund is just a meta-data number
              associated with your asset which the nodes have to keep
              track of to know how many RVN are currently backing up
              your asset. The Raven_Fund number for all currently
              existing assets just happens to be zero until this
              RavenVault functionality is implemented<br>
              <br>
              A "mint" command just combines an "issue' with a
              "monetize". A "remint" command is a "melt" in reverse but
              can only be done by the person who has the owner token. A
              "reissue" is similar to a "remint" but creates new assets
              instead of taking them from the AQ and can change
              additional metadata (units, reissueable, ipfs_hash).<br>
            </blockquote>
            <br>
            <u><b>A simple use case example:</b></u><br>
            <blockquote>Currently, Ravencoin depends entirely on the
              traditional legal system to give value to on-chain asset
              tokens tied to real-world assets. The RavenVault extension
              provides the ability to choose any business model you
              prefer ranging from fully on-chain value to traditional
              legal value or any mix in between.<br>
              <br>
              Let me describe a simple on-chain example. You might
              decide to start a company called Ravenco which provides
              security services and products, along with Joe and myself
              and 4 other friends. So you issue the "Ravenco" asset
              having 10 tokens. You keep 3 tokens for yourself,
              Joe&nbsp; gets 2 tokens for his expertise, I get 1.9
              tokens because I am in charge of security, our accountant
              friend gets 0.1 token because the chain does most of the
              work, and 3 other friends get one token. You might write a
              subscription security blog, and the on-line shopping cart,
              which collects payment in RVN, immedicately "monetizes"
              the RVN to the Ravenco Raven_Fund. You also give your
              subscriber list to me. I teach self-defence classes, and
              with the money I collect, I buy RVN and "monetize" them to
              the Raven_Fund. After a while, the Raven_Fund contains
              1000 RVN, so every Ravenco token has a face value (book
              value in Wall Street lingo) of 100 RVN, and your 3 tokens
              are worth 300 RVN. Then one of our friends needs cash, so
              he "melts" his token, which pays him 100 RVN and increases
              the Authorized_Quantity to 1.<br>
              Your 3 tokens are still worth 300 RVN. After that, you
              could "remint" that AQ token to a new business partner. Or
              you could reissue new tokens for new investors. But either
              way, I don't have to worry about you diluting my value
              because the "remint" and "reissue" commands fail unless
              you provide enough RVN to cover the face value of the
              tokens being put into circulation. So new partners have to
              buy-in at a minimum of face value. But of course, you
              could provide more value during the "remint" or "reissue".
              Perhaps Craig Wright would desperately want to buy the
              token because he thinks that Ravenco will take over the
              world, and he is willing to pay 1.2 million RVN. Then you
              could "remint" the token from AQ to him while specifing
              the fund_address as his address which contains the 1.2
              million RVN. After that transaction, your 3 Ravenco tokens
              are worth 360270 RVN. So you and I and our friends "melt"
              our tokens to get our RVN and go start a new company. All
              enforced on-chain. With more security than a programmed
              smart contract could ever offer.<br>
              <br>
              The Ravenco asset has a single Raven_Fund number attached
              to it which represents the number of RVN taken out of
              circulation and put into escrow to back that asset. So if
              there are 1000 RVN in the Ravenco Raven_Fund and there are
              10 Ravenco tokens currently in circulation, then each
              token has a face value of 100 RVN. In my example, the
              Raven_Fund accumulated 1000 RVN from business profit
              "monetize" transactions, then dropped 100 RVN when our
              friend "melt"ed his token, then added 1.2 Million RVN when
              a token was "remint"ed to Craig. So at the end, there are
              1000-100+1200000 RVN in the Raven_Fund of Ravenco and
              still 10 tokens in circulation. So dividing the Raven_Fund
              quantity by the token count of 10 gives each token a face
              value of 120090 RVN available by "melt"ing.<br>

            </blockquote>
            <blockquote><b>Note 3:</b> It is important to recognize the
              possible impact of round-off errors when calculating the
              "face value" of an asset. Since any number of RVN are
              allowed when creating the Raven_Fund for an asset or when
              adding to the Raven_Fund, it is possible for the "face
              value" of a single token to be a number with an infinite
              number of decimal places.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For instance:<br>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>If a "mintasset" is executed to create 12 asset
                  tokens backed by a Raven_Fund of 4 RVN, then each
                  token will have a "face value" of 0.33333... RVN.</li>
                <li>Likewise, a "mintasset" command creating 12 assets
                  with a Raven_Fund of 3 RVN, followed by a
                  "monetizeasset" command of 1 RVN to the same asset,
                  will create the same result.</li>
              </ol>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If round-off errors are not taken into
              account, the movement of RVN back and forth between
              circulation and Raven_Funds can impact the total RVN
              supply.<br>
              <br>
              &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>In order to accurately preserve the
                total RVN supply in existence, round-off errors are best
                handled as follows:</b><br>
              <ol type="A">
                <li>Any number of RVN are allowed during "mintasset" or
                  "monetizeasset" commands.</li>
                <li>When doing "face value" calculations, round up for
                  "remintasset" and "reissueasset" commands; round down
                  for the "meltasset" command. In other words, remint
                  and reissue will always require a small over-payment,
                  while melts will always yield a small under-payout.
                  This will insure that the holder of the asset owner
                  token cannot repeatedly remint or reissue and then
                  melt to extract RVN from the Raven_Fund. Also,
                  round-off errors will accumulate in the Raven_Fund,
                  which slowly raises the face value of the remaining
                  tokens in circulation.</li>
                <li>If all tokens are melted (that is, all tokens are
                  moved from circulation to AQ), the amount payed out
                  during the final melt command should be set equal to
                  the value of the Raven_Fund balance. This insures that
                  the final Raven_Fund=0 and the total RVN supply is
                  accurately maintained.</li>
              </ol>
