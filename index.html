              <i><b>*An RIP to enable fungible assets on the blockchain
                  to have native value in the form of Ravencoin
                  currency*</b></i><br>
            </div>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>What:</b> The purpose of this RIP is to modify
                the Ravencoin consensus core protocol to enable fungible
                assets on the Ravencoin blockchain to have native value
                in the form of Ravencoin currency (ie a "face value"). </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Why:</b> The Ravencoin protocol is an extension
                of the bitcoin protocol design which natively supports
                the creation and management of assets. But adoption and
                use of those assets depends on the traditional legal and
                banking systems to establish the link of value between a
                Ravencoin asset and a real world asset. The result is
                that the rate of adoption of Ravencoin is determined by
                the rate of adoption of blockchain technology by the
                traditional legal and banking systems. Currently,
                Ravencoin lacks the ability to assign value to on-chain
                assets denominated in the local Ravencoin currency. This
                is an oversight because the flexibility built into the
                Ravenocoin protocol can fully support this with the
                ability to securely and atomically trade between the
                asset and the currency in a single transaction. </li>
            </ul>

              <li>The new RavenVault RPC commands as specified do not
                support restricted assets. But the ideas described here
                could be generalized to add support for restricted
                assets if that is desired.</li>
              <li>The new RavenVault RPC commands as specified do not
                impose any fees above the standard transaction fees
                required by miners. Additional fees could be added to
                burn Ravencoins if that is desired.</li>
              <li>Care must to taken to insure that round-off errors in
                the calculation of Ravencoin-per-asset amounts should
                always be rounded up during remintasset and reissueasset
                commands, while those calculations should round down
                during meltasset commands in order to insure that
                repeated cycles of remint/reissue-to-melt are always
                slightly deflationary and never inflationary. Over time,
                these round-off errors will slowly consume the
                Ravencoins created by the 2020 inflation exploit.</li>

            <u><b>Q &amp; A</b></u><br>
            <br>
            <b>Q:</b> Why is this desired?<br>
            <b>A:</b> This capability would give Ravencoin powerful
            functionality to more fully participate in the
            cryptocurrency and fintech ecosystems. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Q:</b> Can you give an example?<br>
            <b>A:</b> Business founders could distribute assets as
            ownership shares, or people could buy those assets as always
            envisioned for Ravencoin assets. But now, the profits from
            the business can be used to do "monetizeasset" transactions,
            thereby giving the distributed assets immediate value. That
            value could be hodled or traded. Or it could be cashed out
            at any time by doing a "meltasset" and selling the resultant
            Ravencoin currency on any of the exchanges. This model is
            especially powerful for businesses which earn their income
            in cryptocurrency, but it could be used for any business.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Q:</b> Would the sale and transfer price of an asset
            always be determined by the quantity of Ravencoin currency
            held in escrow for that asset?<br>
            <b>A:</b> No. Assets would have a "face value" determined by
            the escrow amount. But assets would have a higher trading
            price determined by the market based on people's
            expectations for the future value of that asset as well by
            the perceived value of the company or community which the
            asset represents. Additionally, there may be real world
            assets attached by traditional legal means to the on-chain
            asset which are not visible on-chain but which can increase
            its trading price.<br>
